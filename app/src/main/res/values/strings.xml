        Quit Habit! App is a motivational app that tracks your daily struggle to stop your habit.
        \n
        \nThis app also tracks daily saved amount of money and have daily motivational quotes.
        \n
        \nI have to mention a special list of authors from which i borrowed design from:
        \n-app icon made by @Roundicons from www.flaticon.com;
        \n-savings icon made by @Eucalyp from www.flaticon.com;
        \n-rank icons made by @Dimitry Miroliubov/Smashicons from www.flaticon.com;
        \n-card icons made by @icongeek26 from www.flaticon.com;
        \n-counter icon made by @starline from www.flaticon.com but made some modifications by myself.
        \n
        \nAs you can see, i did not added any advertising campaign because, i, myself, dislike ads.
        \nIf you enjoyed this app, please support it by sharing it with friends or other people.
        \n\n
        Thank you!"
